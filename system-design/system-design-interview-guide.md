# How to Ace System Design Interviews — A Complete Framework and Checklist

System design interviews are intentionally open-ended and ambiguous. Unlike coding problems with a definitive correct answer, system design interviews assess your ability to think through complex trade-offs, communicate technical decisions clearly, and produce a reasonable architecture under time pressure.

This guide provides a repeatable, structured framework that you can apply to any system design question.

## What System Design Interviews Actually Test

Interviewers are evaluating multiple dimensions simultaneously:

- **Breadth of knowledge:** Do you know the common building blocks? (Databases, caches, queues, load balancers, CDN)
- **Depth of understanding:** Can you explain why you chose one approach over another?
- **Practical instincts:** Do your design decisions reflect real-world considerations?
- **Communication:** Can you articulate complex ideas clearly and structure your thinking?
- **Trade-off reasoning:** Do you acknowledge that every design decision has pros and cons?
- **Scalability thinking:** Do you design for the stated scale, not just for correctness?

System design interviews are **conversations, not monologues**. Engage your interviewer, check assumptions, and invite feedback.

## The 7-Step Framework

### Step 1: Requirements Clarification (5-10 minutes)

Never start designing before you understand what you're building. Spend the first 5-10 minutes asking clarifying questions.

**Functional Requirements (What the system must do):**
- "What are the core features we need to support?"
- "Are there any features we should explicitly exclude?"
- "Who are the primary users? Consumers, businesses, both?"
- "What are the most critical user actions?"

**Non-Functional Requirements (How well the system must do it):**
- "What's the expected scale? How many users? How many requests per second?"
- "What's the read/write ratio?"
- "What availability SLA is required? 99.9%? 99.99%?"
- "Is strong consistency required, or is eventual consistency acceptable?"
- "What latency is acceptable? < 100ms? < 1 second?"
- "Are there geographic requirements? Must the system operate globally?"
- "What are the data retention requirements?"

**Extended Requirements (Nice to have):**
- "Should we include analytics?"
- "Do we need mobile support?"
- "What about internationalization?"

> Write down the agreed requirements and reference them throughout the interview. This keeps you anchored and prevents scope creep.

### Step 2: Capacity Estimation (5 minutes)

Back-of-the-envelope calculations establish the scale of the system and inform your design decisions. Interviewers want to see that you can translate business requirements into technical constraints.

**Traffic Estimation:**
```
Daily Active Users (DAU) × Actions per user per day = Total requests/day
Total requests/day ÷ 86,400 = Requests Per Second (RPS)
```

**Separate read and write RPS:**
```
If read:write ratio = 10:1 and total RPS = 1,000:
  Read RPS = 909 (~910)
  Write RPS = 91 (~90)
```

**Storage Estimation:**
```
Writes per day × Average record size = Storage per day
Storage per day × 365 × Years of retention = Total storage
```

**Bandwidth Estimation:**
```
Ingress: Write RPS × Average request size = Bytes/second
Egress: Read RPS × Average response size = Bytes/second
```

**Cache Estimation:**
```
Apply 80/20 rule: 20% of data serves 80% of reads
Total reads/day × 20% × Average object size = Cache memory required
```

**Useful conversion table:**
| Unit | Value |
|---|---|
| 1 million/day | ~12/second |
| 1 billion/day | ~12,000/second |
| 1 KB × 1 billion | ~1 TB |
| 1 MB × 1 million | ~1 TB |
| 86,400 seconds | 1 day |

### Step 3: Data Model Design (5 minutes)

Define the entities in your system and their relationships. This forces you to think about what data you need and how it's accessed.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- What are the primary entities? (Users, Posts, Products, Orders)
- What are the relationships? (1:1, 1:N, N:M)
- What are the most frequent query patterns? (Read by user ID, search by keyword, range query by date)
- What are the write patterns? (Bulk inserts, frequent updates, append-only)

**Database Selection:**

Choose based on access patterns, not just data structure:

| Use Case | Database Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Strong consistency, complex queries | SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL) | User accounts, financial transactions |
| High write throughput, time-series | Wide-column (Cassandra) | Event logs, messaging, IoT data |
| Flexible schema, document storage | Document (MongoDB) | Product catalogs, CMS |
| Low-latency key lookups | Key-value (Redis, DynamoDB) | Sessions, caching, rate limiting |
| Graph relationships | Graph (Neo4j) | Social networks, fraud detection |
| Full-text search | Search engine (Elasticsearch) | Product search, log analysis |

---

### Step 4: API Design (5 minutes)

Define the interfaces your system exposes. This makes the system's behavior explicit and helps clarify requirements further.

**API design principles:**
- Use RESTful conventions for client-facing APIs
- Use gRPC for internal service-to-service communication
- Pagination is almost always needed for list endpoints
- Version your APIs (`/v1/users`, `/v2/users`)
- Authentication via API keys or JWT Bearer tokens

**Template:**
```
// Action description
HTTP_METHOD /resource[/{id}]
Authorization: {method}
Query params: ?param1=value&page=2&limit=20
Request body: { field1: type, field2: type }
Response {status}: { result_field: type }
```

---

### Step 5: High-Level Component Design (10 minutes)

Draw the major components and how they interact. This is the core of the interview.

**Standard components to consider:**

```
[Client] → [CDN] → [API Gateway / Load Balancer]
                  → [Service A] → [Cache] → [Database]
                  → [Service B] → [Message Queue] → [Worker]
                  → [Service C] → [Object Storage]
```

**Component checklist:**
- [ ] Load balancer / API Gateway (single entry point)
- [ ] Application servers (stateless, horizontally scalable)
- [ ] Primary database (with replication)
- [ ] Cache layer (Redis/Memcached)
- [ ] Object storage (for files/media)
- [ ] CDN (for static assets and media delivery)
- [ ] Message queue (for async processing)
- [ ] Search engine (for full-text search)

**Always ask:**
- "Is this stateless?" (stateless = easy to scale horizontally)
- "Where is state stored?" (should be in the database or cache, not in the service)
- "How do these components communicate?" (REST? gRPC? Async events?)

---

### Step 6: Detailed Design (10-15 minutes)

Deep dive into 2-3 components that are central to the design. Choose areas where interesting trade-offs exist.

**Common deep-dive topics:**

**Database Design:**
- Partitioning/Sharding strategy (hash-based? range-based? geographic?)
- Replication (master-slave? master-master? synchronous vs async?)
- Indexing (what columns to index? Dense vs sparse?)
- Normalization vs denormalization decision

**Caching:**
- What to cache (read-heavy data, computation results)
- Cache invalidation strategy (write-through? write-around? write-back?)
- Eviction policy (LRU is the default safe choice)
- Cache size estimation

**Newsfeed / Fan-out:**
- Fan-out on write vs fan-out on read vs hybrid
- How to handle celebrities/influencers with millions of followers

**Real-Time Features:**
- WebSockets vs Long Polling vs SSE
- How to scale WebSocket connections across multiple server instances

**Search:**
- Elasticsearch for full-text search
- How to keep the search index updated (CDC? Kafka consumer?)

### Step 7: Identify and Resolve Bottlenecks (5 minutes)

Review your design with a critical eye. Every system has bottlenecks — the question is whether you've identified and addressed them.

**Bottleneck checklist:**

| Question | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Single points of failure? | Add redundancy at every tier; active-passive failover |
| Database at capacity? | Read replicas, sharding, caching |
| Cache at capacity? | Distributed cache cluster, increase memory, tune eviction |
| Queue growing unbounded? | Scale consumers, add backpressure, alert on queue depth |
| API Gateway single node? | Deploy multiple instances behind DNS load balancing |
| Network bandwidth exceeded? | CDN offloads static content; compression |
| Hotspot on a database shard? | Consistent hashing; virtual nodes; shard rebalancing |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting to design before clarifying requirements** — You might solve the wrong problem.
2. **Going too deep on a minor component early** — Spend most time on the core design before optimizing.
3. **Not acknowledging trade-offs** — Every design decision has costs. Saying "I'd use X because it's better" without qualification is a red flag.
4. **Ignoring failure modes** — Interviewers want to see that you think about what happens when things go wrong.
5. **Being too vague** — "We'd use a database" is not a design decision. What database? Why? How is it scaled?
6. **Not scaling the design to the stated requirements** — Design for the actual numbers, not a toy scale.
7. **Designing in silence** — Talk through your thought process continuously. The interviewer wants to understand how you think.

## The Three Questions Every Answer Must Address

For every technology or pattern you propose, be prepared to answer:

1. **Why this?** — What specific requirement or constraint does this address?
2. **What's the trade-off?** — What does this solution cost you? (Complexity? Latency? Consistency?)
3. **What's the alternative?** — What would you use instead if constraints were different?

Demonstrating trade-off reasoning is what separates senior engineers from junior engineers in system design interviews.
